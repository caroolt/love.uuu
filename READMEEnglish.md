### :tada: Project Description
###### description
There is a very important person in my life and now I am farther away from her (she moved to another state) and we always play term.ooo/wordle so I decided to make a clone of the game where the words are only compliments, in portuguese. The objective of the game is to make the user guess a word in up to 5 attempts. While the right answer is not given, the player has to risk compliments instead of guessing letters. With each guess, the player gets hints on how close he is to the correct answer. If a letter turns yellow, it means that it is present, but in another position. If it turns green, it is in the right place. Finally, if it turns dark gray, it indicates that it is not present in the compliment.

### :hammer: Project Features
###### project_features
- `Keyboard typing`: The game supports keyboard typing to keep it user-friendly, but has a virtual keyboard for when I switch to mobile;
- `More than one word a day`: Unlike Term.ooo/Wordle you can play more than once just by clicking on the 'reload' button;
- `I don't know how to play`: No problem, in the upper left corner there is a button which has a manual explaining the game;
